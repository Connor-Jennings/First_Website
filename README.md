# First_Website

The purpose of this website is to track my location and compile it into a useable interface.

https://project-found.com is a display of location and other information that is stored in an SQL db. 
The page "addData.html" is an interface to upload data to the db.


In the "PPR" repository there is a python script that uploads data to project-found.com.
