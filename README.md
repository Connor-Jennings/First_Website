# First_Website

The purpose of this website is to have my location tracked realtime by loved ones while I am backpacking

This website is a display of location and other information that is stored in an SQL db
https://project-found.com
The page "addData.html" page is an interface to upload data to the db


In the "PPR" repository there is a python script that uploads data to project-found.com
