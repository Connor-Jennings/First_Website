# First_Website

The purpose of this website is track my location and compile it into a pleasant interface.

This website is a display of location and other information that is stored in an SQL db
https://project-found.com. 
The page "addData.html" page is an interface to upload data to the db.


In the "PPR" repository there is a python script that uploads data to project-found.com.
